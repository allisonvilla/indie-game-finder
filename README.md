## About
Indie Game Finder is an application that helps users find an indie game to play that suits their preferences. It filters through paginated data returned by [RAWG Video Games Database API](https://rawg.io/apidocs) to a display a game to the user based on their chosen parameters.

Users are also able to leave a review on each game page and view reviews written by other users on the reviews page. Reviews are stored in a Firebase Realtime Database.
